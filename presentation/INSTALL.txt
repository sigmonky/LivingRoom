To get this working you will need to install an xmpp server with
PubSub support like ejabberd.

You will also need BOSH support, ejabberd has BOSH support but you can
also use Punjab. 

You will need to copy config.js.dist to config.js and change the
values to what is appropriate. 

Deploy to a publish webserver or use your BOSH server and you are
done!
