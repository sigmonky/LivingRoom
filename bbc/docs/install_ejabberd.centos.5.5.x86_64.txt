Installing Ejabberd on Centos 5.5 ready for PubSub over BOSH
==================================================================

These instructions should help you install Ejabberd, as well as
getting you up and running for XMPP over HTTP via the BOSH interface. 


Download
--------

You can download the latest version from:
http://www.process-one.net/en/ejabberd/downloads

From the dropdown choose one of the 'Linux Installers' rather than source. 
It's just easier. You'll need to choose which architecture. 
You can check by running:

$ uname -m

on the machine you are installing it on. If you see x86_64 then you will 
need to choose the 64bit version, otherwise choose the 32bit.

Copy this file to your destination machine.

NOTE:
You will need root access to install Ejabberd. The rest of these 
instruction will assume you are installing version 2.1.5
on a 64bit machine for the domain vm.local. If you are installing a 
different version then don't panic, just swap the numbers.


Unpack
------

Naviagate to the installer on your destination machine. Unpack with:

$ gunzip ejabberd-2.1.5-linux-x86_64-installer.bin.gz

--

Now make the installer executable

$ chmod +x ejabberd-2.1.5-linux-x86_64-installer.bin


Installation
------------

You can now run the installer. You'll need to choose a language and
accept the license.

Next you be asked where to install. I would install in /opt, so you 
would fill this in with:

/opt/ejabberd-2.1.5

--

Next you will be asked to set a desired domain name. This needs to be 
a domain name that the computer you are installing this on is known as on 
your network. If you are installing ejabberd locally or on a virtual 
machine you could give it a name like vm.local and adjust you hosts file
to suit.

--

Next create the admin user. Try and change the username to something other
than admin. This is the superuser that has full admin control of your installation.

e.g nimda

--

Next you create a password for the admin user

e.g a1b2c3

--

Answer NO to whether this machine is part of a cluster. Mark it as something to
learn about afterwards.

--

That should be it, and you will be asked if you would like to continue and
actually install Ejabberd. Choose Yes.

--

Once this finshes you should have Ejabberd installed in /opt. You can now remove
the installer ejabberd-2.1.5-linux-x86_64-installer.bin


Starting Ejabberd
-----------------

I find the easiest way to manage the starting and stopping of Ejabberd is via a
init.d script. Create a file in /etc/init.d/ called ejabberd the copy and paste this
code into it:

https://gist.github.com/710135

Remembering to change line 13 to point to your installed version.

--

Next you need to make
that file executable and add it to the other programs started on bootup:

$ chmod +x /etc/init.d/ejabberd
$ /sbin/chkconfig --add ejabberd 

You can check this with:

$ /sbin/chkconfig --list ejabberd
ejabberd       	0:off	1:off	2:off	3:on	4:on	5:on	6:off

--

Now we create a user to run it under and change the permission of our install. 
We'll use the user as we have in our init.d script:

// NOTE: we're creating home directly too, so the .erlang.cookie has a home. I'm
// sure there are lots of variations here, but this one works.
$ /usr/sbin/adduser ejabberd  
$ chown -R ejabberd:ejabberd ejabberd-2.1.5/

--

The BOSH interface which allows us to talk XMPP over HTTP is available via
port 5280, along with the admin interface. We need to make this available by
updating the iptables. Load up /etc/sysconfig/iptables in your favourite
editor and add the line:

-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 5280 -j ACCEPT

You probably see a similar line where 5280 is replaced with 22. You can add the line
below that one. To make this change take effect, you'll need to run:

$ /sbin/service/iptables restart

--

Finally, in order to have a PubSub system that anyone can use, we need to
enable anonomous login, otherwise we would have to create an account for
every client that wanted to connect. To enable this you need to edit the
config file:

/opt/ejabberd-2.1.5/conf/ejabberd.cfg

Just after the AUTHENTICATION section (line 250) add this line 

{host_config, "vm.local", [{auth_method, [anonymous]},
                             {anonymous_protocol, both}]}.

You'll then need to restart Ejabberd:

$ /sbin/service ejabberd restart

--

Hurrah!, all installed and ready to go. You should now be able to log into to the ejabberd 
admin interface at:

http://vm.local:5280/admin

and you will be asked for a username and password. This seems to always trip people
up, and they put in the wrong username. To log in as administrator, based on the
information we have used above, it would be:

username: nimda@vm.local
password: a1b2c3

--

So, now you have a working XMPP server. Please note, that what I've explained is enough
to get you going. I can't guarentee that this is a bullet proof secure setup, it's just
a snippet of what's possible. If you want know more, I suggest you visit:
